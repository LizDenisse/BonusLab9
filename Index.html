            <p>Grew up in a town that was famous as a place of movie scenes.

            Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
            There's nothing you can't do, now you're in New York!

            <p>Such a melting pot on the corner selling rock preachers pray to God
            Hail a gypsy cab takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
            Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger far more than an empty fridge
            I'ma make it by any means, I got a pocketful of dreams baby I'm from New York! </p>

            <p>Concrete jungle where dreams are made of

      <p>What would happen if the 1859 solar storms happens again?</p>
      <p> On February 14 the sun erupted with the largest solar flare seen in four yearsâ€”big enough to interfere with radio communications and GPS signals for airplanes on long-distance flights.</p>
      <p>As solar storms go, the Valentine's Day flare was actually modest. But the burst of activity is only the start of the upcoming solar maximum, due to peak in the next couple of years.</p>
      <p>"The sun has an activity cycle, much like hurricane season," Tom Bogdan, director of the Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado, said earlier this month at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington, D.C</p>
      <p>"It's been hibernating for four or five years, not doing much of anything." Now the sun is waking up, and even though the upcoming solar maximum may see a record low in the overall amount of activity, the individual events could be very powerful.</p>
      <p>In fact, the biggest solar storm on record happened in 1859, during a solar maximum about the same size as the one we're entering, according to NASA.</p>
      <p>That storm has been dubbed the Carrington Event, after British astronomer Richard Carrington, who witnessed the megaflare and was the first to realize the link between activity on the sun and geomagnetic disturbances on Earth.</p>
      <p>During the Carrington Event, northern lights were reported as far south as Cuba and Honolulu, while southern lights were seen as far north as Santiago, Chile. (See pictures of auroras generated by the Valentine's Day solar flare.)</p>
